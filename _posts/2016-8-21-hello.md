title: ! 'Hello'
---

I made a blog. The name sort of presented itself. Consider it... a Stream of Kyle.

For some background, I'm a software engineer (fancy name for programmer) working on the Virtual Reality team of a super cool, huge online gaming platform. My blog is not going to talk about that. The purpose of this blog is to share my journey and side-project in making a procedurally generated game.

That being said, I hate procedural generation in games. No Man's Sky was uniform and uninteresting. It really takes a human touch to make something truly engaging... for now. But I don't think convincing emulation of human creativity is unobtainable.

I believe that humans are entirely incapable of randomness. Try your best to think of a number between 1 and 10. Was it 3 or 7? Would you be surprised if you flipped a coin 50 times and it landed on heads 50 times? This is the quality of human thinking that can be truly exploited in procedural generation. More to come on this subject in future posts!
