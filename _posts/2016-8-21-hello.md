title: ! 'Hello'

I made a blog. Consider it... a stream of Kyle.

For some background, I'm a software engineer (fancy name for programmer) working on the Virtual Reality team of a super cool, huge online gaming platform. You can probably guess which one. My blog is not going to talk about that much because I'm currently working on a little procedural generation project. I'll post pictures of it and some fun insights into my thought process. And by that, I mean I'll post pictures of poop. Because that's basically my thought process.

On a slightly more serious note, I hate procedural generation in games. Let's be honest, No Man's Sky was crap. Minecraft is crap. It's all uniform and uninteresting. It really takes a human touch to make something interesting... at least until our methods improve. I don't think that human-level creativity is unobtainable by *all* procedural algorithms *ever* , just *our current* procedural algorithms. That's why I'm doing this. Most of my life revolves around doing things I hate in the hopes that I can do it better.

And with that, I have realized it is 2:48 AM. Oops.
