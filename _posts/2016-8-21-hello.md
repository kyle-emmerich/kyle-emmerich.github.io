I made a blog. Consider it... a stream of Kyle.

For some background, I'm a software engineer (fancy name for programmer) working on the Virtual Reality team of a super cool, huge online gaming platform. You can probably guess which one. My blog is not going to talk about that much because I'm currently working on a little procedural generation project.

I hate procedural generation in games. No Man's Sky was uniform and uninteresting. It really takes a human touch to make something interesting; at least until our methods improve. I don't think human-level creativity is unobtainable though.
